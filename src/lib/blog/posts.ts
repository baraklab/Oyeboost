Describe the idea, generate the scaffolding, wire up a database, ship a landing page, and by Sunday night there’s a live URL. The barrier to _building_ has nearly disappeared.",

That part is still slow, personal, and often a little uncomfortable — and it hasn’t changed at all in the AI era. If anything, it’s gotten harder, because now _everyone_ can spin up a prototype, which means more products are competing for the same sliver of attention, while people’s trust and wallets haven’t grown to match.

One founder in a legacy industry spent months cold-emailing with almost no response, then walked the floor of a single industry trade show and closed more deals in three days than in three months of email.

Another regularly showed up at customer offices uninvited, was turned away most of the time, and once flew to meet a prospect who ended the meeting after eight minutes — yet that same account eventually became one of his largest. Small, industry-specific conferences converted especially well, using a simple mini-playbook: set up back-to-back 15-minute meeting slots for the event, email the attendee list before it starts to fill the calendar, and follow up again mid-event to catch anyone who missed the first email. Several founders also ran small founder dinners for 6–10 ideal customers, costing roughly $50–100, which consistently converted better than large sponsored events — once someone’s shared a meal with you, ignoring your follow-up email becomes much harder.",

One founder made this his full-time job for a couple of months, posting several times a day across Reddit and Facebook groups, occasionally getting shadowbanned, but still generating steady customers. The same principle extends to Discord servers, YouTube comments, and niche industry forums — wherever the complaint is public, that’s where to show up.

            "Yes, but publishing identical text on both usually underperforms. Amplibee takes one source post and generates a short, hook-driven version for X and a longer, context-rich version for LinkedIn, then publishes both automatically from the same workflow.",

          question: "What's the difference between cross-posting and social media posting automation?",
          answer:
            "Cross-posting typically means copying the same text to every platform. Posting automation, as Amplibee implements it, rewrites the source post into a platform-native version for each destination before publishing, so the format fits the platform instead of just duplicating text.",
        },
        {
          question: "Does automating my posts hurt engagement compared to posting manually?",
          answer:
            "Not when the automation adapts content per platform instead of duplicating it. Engagement typically drops when the same generic text is blasted everywhere — not because the post was automated, but because it wasn't shaped for the platform it landed on.",
        },
        {
          question: "Which platforms can I publish to automatically with Amplibee?",
          answer:

        },
        {
          question: "Is social media automation worth it for a solo founder?",
          answer:
            "For a solo founder or small team, automation mainly buys back time: instead of manually rewriting and posting to each platform, you write once, review the generated versions, and publish everywhere from one dashboard — without giving up review control over what actually goes out.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need my own OpenAI or Anthropic API key?",
          answer:
            "Yes — Amplibee runs on your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter API key rather than reselling AI tokens. You connect it once under Settings → AI Providers; it's encrypted at rest and only decrypted server-side when a generation actually runs.",
